# Hello-World
This is where I put my ideas and what I dream I can put forth towards the future.
The world is a big place such a big place that it fits 7 billion humans inside and you are one og those human.The real question is what difference can you make out of those 7 billion humans that are a live. You see with programming it is an art where you can create anything you can imagine.The only limit is your imagination. So imagine big and change the world!
